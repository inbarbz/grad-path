Alternatively, you may be an experienced Graduate/Junior Software Engineer looking to take that next step; the BBC have supported many colleagues in progressing their careers and moving through the job family.\n\nIn terms of specific technical experience, ideally you would be skilled in:\n\n- Front end web technologies (Javascript/React)\n\n- Cloud technologies (AWS or similiar).\n\nAs the team generally work full stack, experience in (or an interest to gain experience in) the following would be beneficial (but not essential).\n\n- Java and its associated tools and frameworks,\n\n- SQL/NoSQL database technologies.\n\nWe are a team that likes to work collaboratively, often through pairing. We like practices such as Agile, Behaviour-Driven Development, Test-Driven Development and Continuous Deployment but, more importantly, we like continuous improvement - we embrace change.\n\nIf you think you could thrive in this sort of environment we strongly encourage you to apply',

That means a company that understands programmers, and knows how to deliver quality software. Being a small team means we can move quickly, and get lots done.\n\nAbout Us\n\nWith a ban on admin fees, and a focus on fairness, OpenRent is a force for good in an industry often tarnished by rip-off agencies. With an unrelenting focus on technology, we now let more properties than any other agency in the UK. Operating nationwide, there are over 6.3 million OpenRenters - with tens of millions renting in the UK (and many more abroad!) the opportunity is... huge and we continue to grow rapidly, breaking new records every month.\n\nOpenRent is very much of the startup mindset, a close-knit team looking for stellar growth and to transform an industry. When you make a change to the OpenRent code base, you're affecting the real lives of millions of tenants and landlords across the UK - this is a job with a big impact, and big reward.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nWe expect everyone at OpenRent to have a good understanding of product, dive into customer development issues, and come up with simple / novel / unique (whatever fits the requirement) solutions to the problems our users face every day. We're revolutionising the lettings industry, and it takes constant creative thinking and problem solving to do that effectively.\n\nAlthough we are language-agnostic when looking for candidates, our current tech stack includes:\n• C# Latest (we always run latest)\n• .NET 8, EF Core\n• SQL Server\n• HTML/Razor, SCSS/CSS, TypeScript/Javascript\n• ML.NET, Elasticsearch, AWS (S3/Route53/EC2/Cloudfront), and much more\n• Continuous Deployment\n• Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)\n\nWe have dedicated front-end developers in the team to support our full-stack and back-end engineers - so you'll have support on UX/UI if and when required.\n\nAs an engineer, you'll be expected to turn your customer solutions into code, and not only deliver on the promise of turning a problem into a solution, but into something that seems obvious once it becomes used by millions of people nationwide. Before OpenRent, it was normal to rent a property by visiting the high street, signing paperwork in an office, and paying crazy high fees - not so any more - and now we're working on re-shaping the industry so that in 5 years it's barely recognisable from where we are today.\n• Core hire into our development team\n• Industry experience preferred\n• Become engineer #15, with a huge opportunity to impact how we write code / what we work on\n• Opportunity to craft a role to your desire, and make company wide decisions\n• Dedicated to the cause of dramatically improving the rental market\n\nWe are looking for the smartest candidates (like you!) to join the company, help us take over the industry, and share in our success",

By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\n\nThe Role\n\nSoftware Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organisations use data. Our Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, prototyping, and production delivery. You will collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product. Engineers work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop, becoming a strong... technical contributor and engineering leader.\n\nOur Product Development organisation is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product. Our infrastructure teams are responsible for the lowest layers of our software stack, often focused on storage, security, search, and application infrastructure. As a Software Engineer on infrastructure, you'll contribute high-quality code to underpin Palantir Foundry and Gotham with performant, secure, and scalable building blocks, enabling products deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build the foundational capabilities that power our products used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world.\n\nPlease note that this posting is open to all levels of experience. The team is hiring for frontend- and backend-focused engineers.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n• We're hiring engineers who are passionate about solving real-world problems and empowering developers and end-users to do their work optimally. If you’re motivated to develop reliable, performant, scalable systems and design robust APIs and primitives, some examples of the types of product work you’d get to do are:\n• Building performant search and indexing ecosystem for complex granularly permissioned of data.\n• Designing architecture and opinionated APIs to keep application developers on the happy path.\n• Tracing and performance observability in high scale distributed microservice architectures.\n• Building reliant, performant, and scalable systems for storage, auth, or asset serving to enable other product teams to build robust applications without deep domain expertise in the underlying systems.\n• Automating the deployment, management, and operations of complex distributed systems like Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Kafka, and more across different environments.\n\nTechnologies We Use\n• Different languages, including Java and Go for backend and Typescript for frontend.\n• Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Lucene, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux.\n• Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub.\n\nWhat We Value\n• Demonstrated ability to collaborate and empathise with a variety of individuals. You can iterate with users and non-technical stakeholders and understand how your technical decisions impact them.\n• Ability to learn new technology and concepts, even without in-depth experience. Experience developing and managing highly-available distributed systems is beneficial but not required.\n• Bias towards quality and thoughtful about edge cases (“anything that can go wrong will go wrong”); writes code that is defensive against all possibilities. Refuses to accept that things will be “probably fine.”\n• Motivated by unlocking or improving user workflows while maintaining engineering quality. Seeks to centralise and abstract complexity away from our users in order to expose simple, powerful APIs for consumers.\n\nWhat We Require\n• Engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics or similar field.\n• Strong coding skills with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.\n• Ability to dive into and navigate existing complex systems to better understand the nuances in how they work.\n• Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, and other technical tools.\n• Strong written and verbal communication skills.\n\nLife at Palantir\n\nWe want every Palantirian to achieve their best outcomes, that’s why we celebrate individuals’ strengths, skills, and interests, from your first interview to your longterm growth, rather than rely on traditional career ladders. Paying attention to the needs of our community enables us to optimize our opportunities to grow and helps ensure many pathways to success at Palantir.

Our mission is to create the best and most empowering way to pay, for anything, anywhere our customers want to spend. Using Zilch’s virtual Mastercard that sits in a customer’s digital wallet, Zilch combines the best of debit, credit and savings. Meaning our customers can either earn rewards on debit payments in the form of instant cashback (‘Pay in 1’) or spread interest-free repayments over six weeks (‘Pay in 4’), bringing them financial choice and maturing their credit profiles.\n\nThis is uniquely made possible by the proprietary Ad-Subsidised Payment Network (ASPN) that Zilch has built, which in cookieless world enables merchants around the world to connect directly with the millions of Zilch customers they otherwise couldn’t reach and offer them savings, deals and discounts.\n\nBy vertically integrating with consumers, rather than with... merchants, Zilch allows customers to pay using either reward-earning debit or interest-free credit, both online and in-store, anywhere Mastercard is accepted. To ensure we are helping our customers to manage their cash flow responsibly when they make credit payments, we set dynamic borrowing limits using best-in-market data from leading credit reference agencies, open banking technology and behavioural data analysis. Together these generate a real-time, comprehensive, 360-degree view of a customer’s affordability profile, allowing us to set personalised borrowing limits accordingly. To further bolster our customer safeguards, we are fully regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, having obtained a consumer credit license prior to our launch.\n\nSince launching as an FCA regulated business in the UK in September 2020 and in the US in May 2022, Zilch has amassed over 3 million customers in 24 months and turned gross profitable – years faster than other well-known fintechs. In that time, we have provided our customers with over £80 million in aggregate rewards and savings on fees and interest. Zilch is Europe’s fastest-ever company to go from Series A to double-unicorn status, in just 14 months, after raising capital at a $2bn valuation in November 2021 and maintaining that valuation in a subsequent equity funding round in Summer 2022.\n\nAbout the role:\n\nZilch is searching for talented Java Software Engineers to join our dynamic and fast-paced team. We are looking to speak with coding enthusiasts who live and breathe software, and who obsess about quality.

    'description': "A World-Changing Company\n\nPalantir builds the world’s leading software for data-driven decisions and operations. By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\n\nThe Role\n\nSoftware Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organisations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer Intern, you’ll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned, as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir Gotham, Palantir Foundry, or Palantir Apollo: products that are deployed at some of the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organisation is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each... focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\nAs a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties.\n\nSWE principles include:\n\n• Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.\n\n• Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems.\n\n• Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want people to have the space to think for themselves, while feeling supported by their team.\n\nTechnologies We Use\n\nIt doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you’re a former university TA, switched to CS recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast — you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:\n\n• Varying languages, including Java and Go for backend and Typescript for frontend\n\n• Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, Elasticsearch, React, and Redux\n\n• Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub\n\nWhat We Value\n• Ability to communicate and collaborate with a variety of individuals, including engineers, users and non-technical team members.\n• Willingness to learn and make decisions independently, and the ability to ask questions when stuck.\n\nWhat We Require\n• Engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics.\n• Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.\n• Experience coding in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.\n• Must be planning on graduating in 2025. This should be your final internship before graduating.\n\nTo apply, please submit the following:\n• An updated resume / CV\n• Thoughtful responses to our application questions\n\nOffer Deadline\n\nIn an effort to build more transparency into our recruitment process, we’d like to share our offer deadline expectations. By applying to this position, you commit to confirming your decision within two weeks of receiving your written offer.\n\nLife at Palantir\n\nWe want every Palantirian to achieve their best outcomes, that’s why we celebrate individuals’ strengths, skills, and interests, from your first interview to your longterm growth, rather than rely on traditional career ladders. Paying attention to the needs of our community enables us to optimize our opportunities to grow and helps ensure many pathways to success at Palantir. Promoting health and well-being across all areas of Palantirians’ lives is just one of the ways we’re investing in our community. Learn more at Life at Palantir and note that our offerings may vary by region.\n\nIn keeping consistent with Palantir’s values and culture, we believe employees are “better together” and in-person work affords the opportunity for more creative outcomes. Therefore, we encourage employees to work from our offices to foster connectivity and innovation. Many teams do offer hybrid options (WFH a day or two a week), allowing our employees to strike the right trade-off for their personal productivity.

    'description': "The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to create a better, more open internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising. Handling over 1 trillion queries per day, our platform operates at an unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, ownership, empathy, and collaboration. We value the unique experiences and perspectives that each person brings to The Trade Desk, and we are committed to fostering inclusive spaces where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work every day.\n\nDo you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally- connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small- to medium-sized workplaces globally.\n\nWhat We Do\n\nOur Lead Staff Software Engineers are... end-to-end owners who will participate in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering data-focused products for our stakeholders.\u202f\n\nAt The Trade Desk, we believe that each opportunity to engage with all internal and external stakeholders is unique. This means that based on your interests and background, you will have the opportunity to work on large-scale, distributed systems, for example, coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and\u202finteractive user interfaces, to name a few.\n\nOur system performs every day, 24/7, serving global traffic. It’s important that we focus on quality at scale in an agile environment based on collaboration, ownership, and trust. Our software engineering teams fully own their charter to work on long-term roadmaps while enhancing existing features or tools and continuously improving efficiency.\n\nWhat you’ll do:\n\nIt’s the best of both worlds—you'll get a chance to exercise your technical leadership and build up your people management and leadership skills. Some of the work that you will be doing to help us deliver on our mission includes the following:\n\nTechnical leadership\n• Actively review design and code.\n• Deliver meaningful technical and hands-on contributions to the team's objectives.\n• Understand strategic business priorities and communicate with the team on how their work fits into the roadmap.\n\nProject level processes and execution\n• Collaborate with the PM (product management) team to develop the roadmap and MVP plans.\n• Develop execution plans (resources, milestones, and timelines) for the roadmaps.\n• Continuously analyze and optimize team efficiency.\n• Establish and deliver on team commitments.\n• Measure and maintain/improve the quality of the team's contributions.\n• Communicate important developments and changes to area leadership and other stakeholders.\n\nPeople management\n• Manage a small team. (no more then 4 people max, but start with less)\n• Help team members develop career growth plans.\n• Give regular and effective feedback.\n• Hold weekly 1:1 meetings with direct reports.\n• Annual reviews and compensation recommendations.\n\nWe are a global team with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be well-versed in building from common ground to value, seek out, and foster invisible and visible dimensions of diversity.\n\nWho you are:\n\nOur culture is much deeper than just having fun together (though we do that well, too). We take pride in our engineers being trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence. You do not have to meet all the requirements below, but we believe that people who meet most of them will have a higher likelihood of succeeding in this role:\n• You have a solid understanding of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle), DevOps, and agile methodologies.\n• You have a solid understanding of cloud computing.\n• You have a solid understanding of design patterns and software architecture design patterns.\n• You have experience in contributing to professional growth of software engineers.\n• You have experience in providing technical and project leadership of initiatives involving multiple teams.\n• You have experience in leading and completing projects with a high degree of technical ambiguity.\n• You have a proven track record of effectively growing multiple senior engineers and tech leads.\n• You have experience in driving major, strategic, company-wide initiatives with significant risk.\n• You have experience in hiring and conducting interviews.\n• You are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: C#, Java, C, C++, Python, SQL, Scala, Typescript/JavaScript.\n• You have 1+ years of experience directly managing people.\n\nA variety of technical opportunities is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a software engineer, which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and find solutions to complex problems using the optimum tools for the job.\u202fWhat you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We are not seeking engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent answers no one has thought of yet and find answers to the questions yet to be asked.\u202f\n\nThe Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is an equal opportunity employer. All aspects of employment will be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic information, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran status, or any other status protected under federal, state, or local law",
