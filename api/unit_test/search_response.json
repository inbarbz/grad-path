Our Meetings & Events team within Enterprise Services works closely with BCG’s senior leaders to plan and manage BCG’s event programs, always with a focus on sustainability, attendee experience, and technology innovation. Transforming the digital products supporting our processes is a critical enabler of success. This is a dynamic environment, and as such the Product Owner will be crucial in helping to define the digitally-enabled future of Meetings & Events at BCG.\n\nTo help execute this transformation, we need a Product Owner that will lead our Meetings & Events digital product squad in setting, prioritizing, and evaluating the work generated by the Squad to ensure a best-in-class sustainable experience.

    "description": "This a Full Remote job, the offer is available from: United Kingdom\n\nWho We Are\n\nThe name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As organizations rely more on cloud services and the Internet, the network has become a “black box” outside of their control. ThousandEyes gives organizations visibility and insight into the now borderless network. It arms them with an accurate understanding of how the network impacts their applications, users and customers. ThousandEyes is used by some of the world’s largest and fastest growing brands, including all of the top 5 global software companies, 5 of the top 6 US banks, and 45 of the Fortune 500.\n\nThousandEyes’ pioneered Cloud and Internet Intelligence and is widely known as the ‘Google Maps of the Internet.’ Today, ThousandEyes is central to the global operations of the world’s largest and fastest-growing brands. The company... was acquired by Cisco in August 2020, chartered with continuing to drive leadership in empowering organizations to see, understand, and improve digital experiences everywhere.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nThe rise of as-a-service models has given birth to unknown dependencies that create blind spots for enterprise teams. Our product management team focuses on ingesting, visualizing, and correlating network flow traffic with our existing market-leading synthetics dataset. Our team helps customers solve problems that originate within the network infrastructure they own.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nLast year, ThousandEyes acquired SamKnows, and, in an era where connectivity is paramount, the acquisition of SamKnows marks a significant step forward in our mission to enhance network visibility and performance, particularly in the critical last-mile segment and within consumer homes. This integration empowers Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and consumers with insightful data to identify connectivity and application issues, whether they originate in the home or beyond.\n\nWe are looking for a visionary Senior Product Manager to spearhead this transformative integration. Your role will be pivotal in developing innovative solutions that provide real-time insights into network performance in the last mile and consumer environments. This position demands a blend of business acumen, technical expertise in network software, a deep understanding of ISP infrastructure, and a consumer-centric approach to problem-solving.\n\nWhat You Will Do\n• Lead the development and launch of cutting-edge solutions that enhance network visibility in the last mile and within the home.\n• Collaborate closely with technical teams from both SamKnows and ThousandEyes to ensure seamless integration of technologies and expertise.\n• Engage directly with ISPs and consumers to thoroughly understand their connectivity challenges and tailor solutions to address these issues effectively.\n• Conduct in-depth market research and competitive analysis to stay ahead of industry trends and position our products strategically.\n• Define a clear and ambitious product vision and roadmap, focusing on innovation, usability, and impact in network performance monitoring.\n• Facilitate cross-functional team collaboration, ensuring alignment with the product goals and adherence to development timelines.\n• Partner with Marketing, Sales, and Customer Success teams to craft compelling narratives and tools that resonate with our target audiences, driving successful product adoption and market penetration.\n\nRequired Skills\n• A minimum of 6 years of experience in product management, with a significant focus on network performance software and ISP services.\n• Experience in enterprise/SaaS software products\n• Prior experience in a startup or dynamic technology environment, particularly involving network monitoring or management software solutions.\n• Deep knowledge of network performance metrics, diagnostic tools, and software applications relevant to ISP infrastructure and home networking.\n• Strong analytical skills, with the ability to translate complex technical concepts into consumer-friendly solutions.\n• Excellent communication and collaboration abilities, capable of leading diverse teams and engaging effectively with various stakeholders.\n• A self-starter attitude fueled by passion and energy, with the capability to drive innovation and lead change in a fast-paced industry.\n\nCisco values the perspectives and skills that emerge from employees with diverse backgrounds. That's why Cisco is expanding the boundaries of discovering top talent by not only focusing on candidates with educational degrees and experience but also placing more emphasis on unlocking potential. We believe that everyone has something to offer and that diverse teams are better equipped to solve problems, innovate, and create a positive impact.\n\nWe encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification. Research shows that people from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy. We urge you not to prematurely exclude yourself and to apply if you're interested in this work.\n\nCisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis. Cisco will consider for employment, on a case by case basis, qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.\n\nThis offer from \"ThousandEyes\" has been enriched by Jobgether.com and got a 75% flex score",
